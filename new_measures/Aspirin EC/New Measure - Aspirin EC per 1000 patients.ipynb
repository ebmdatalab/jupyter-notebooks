    "## Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "Patients sometimes get prescribed aspirin with a \"gastro-resistant\" coating (also called enteric coating or EC) in order to protect from the gastro-intestinal side-effects associated with aspirin, by stopping the tablet dissolving in the stomach, and instead dissolving in the higher pH duodenum.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, according to UKMI, there is only weak evidence to suggest reduced blood loss or decreased GI ulceration with EC aspirin, and that it is insufficient to support a clinical benefit over standard release (plain) aspirin.  In addition, there is speculation that enteric coating reduces the anti-platelet effect of aspirin, and thus its efficacy in the prevention of cardiovascular events. The available evidence for this is conflicting. There is a theory of pseudoresistance reflecting delayed and reduced drug absorption with EC aspirin over normal plain aspirin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, EC aspirin should not be routinely used in preference to uncoated aspirin products.\n",
