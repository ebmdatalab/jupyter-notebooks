    "The Advisory Committee on Borderline Substances (ACBS) is responsible for assessing and recommending products applying for listing in Part XV of the Drug Tariff. The ACBS recently reviewed some products listed in Part XV to ensure they are still clinically effective and appropriate to be listed here. They considered the probiotics VSL#3 and Vivomixx and advised the Secretary of State  for Health and Social Care to remove these products. The Secretary of State accepted this recommendation and removed the products from the drug tariff.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Committee concluded that the evidence did not sufficiently demonstrate that the products are clinically effective. Additionally the ACBS & MHRAâ€™s consider the presentation of a product to prevent a clinical condition such as pouchitis as a specific medicinal claim. Therefore these products now fall within the definition of a medicine (not  a \"borderline\" substance) and should be regulated as such. Importantly this means that they are also allowed on prescription, despite them not currently being licnsed as a medicine and having been removed from the drug tariff as the evidence does not support them meeting the threshold for Part XV of the Drug Tariff."

    "_Why it matters_: The Advisory Committee on Borderline Substances has reconsidered the evidence for VSL#3 and Vivomixx to be listed in part XV of the Drug Tariff. The committee felt that the evidence does not meet the threshold for inclusion and the claims made that these preparations prevent medical conditions means they are more appropirtaely subject to medicines legislation. despite them not currently being licnsed as a medicine and having been removed from the drug tariff as the evidence does not support them meeting the threshold for Part XV of the Drug Tariff."
